## Cloud Security Response Analyst, [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com)

### Cheltenham March 2021 – October 2022

- Worked as a Cloud Security Response Analyst for the C+AI division. Due to the sheer size of the platform that we monitored, the role taught me how to effectively triage and investigate incidents in a fast yet reliable manner. On top of how to respond to incidents, the role also taught me how to analyse and modify detections so that adjustments can be made to improve their fidelity.
- Forensic and Malware Analysis are the two areas of development I focussed on to broaden my skillset, however my larger bodies of work involve the use of my skills around scripting to improve the day-to-day processes of analysts.
- Mentored the Summer 2022 interns by PM’ing their projects from start to finish. Presented training sessions to teach them the different roles one experiences working in a Cloud SOC, including shadowing of case work.

## Intern, [Reliance acsn](https://relianceacsn.co.uk/)

### London, June 2019

During my second year I was part of a larger intern team. We were tasked with setting up a virtual lab environment to test our Red Team skills on. This broadened my networking knowledge as I now understand how a Windows Server and Active Directory works. We were also given talks on different departments of the company to broaden our knowledge of the industry.

## Intern, [Crowdform](https://www.crowdform.co.uk/)

### London, September 2018

Having never had any experience with JavaScript, I was given a course to do so that I could increase my expertise in the web development area.
My previous knowledge of HTML/CSS and Databases were extremely useful when I came on to the more hands on work, such as gaining an understanding of Node.js and React.js and applying it to real world applications.

## Intern, [Reliance acsn](https://relianceacsn.co.uk/)

### London, June 2018

Working under the arm of the penetration testing team for my first stint at Reliance taught me a lot of the fundamentals of this line of work. For the majority of the time I was shadowing the team taking notes on how pentesting is carried out and the different aspects of the job. Towards the end of my time I was set a project in which I compiled my own report on a lab machine - which taught me to use programs such as ncat, metasploit and increased my python scripting skills.
