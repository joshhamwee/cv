## Intern, [Reliance acsn](https://relianceacsn.co.uk/)

### London, June 2019

During my second year I was part of a larger intern team. We were tasked with setting up a virtual lab environment to test our Red Team skills on. This broadened my networking knowledge as I now understand how a Windows Server and Active Directory works. We were also given talks on different departments of the company to broaden our knowledge of the industry.

## Intern, [Crowdform](https://www.crowdform.co.uk/)

### London, September 2018

Having never had any experience with JavaScript, I was given a course to do so that I could increase my expertise in the web development area.
My previous knowledge of HTML/CSS and Databases were extremely useful when I came on to the more hands on work, such as gaining an understanding of Node.js and React.js and applying it to real world applications.

### London, June 2018

Working under the arm of the penetration testing team for my first stint at Reliance taught me a lot of the fundamentals of this line of work. For the majority of the time I was shadowing the team taking notes on how pentesting is carried out and the different aspects of the job. Towards the end of my time I was set a project in which I compiled my own report on a lab machine - which taught me to use programs such as ncat, metasploit and increased my python scripting skills.
