# Conan Cook

Product-oriented full-stack engineering manager.  I'm focused on feedback, honesty and growth.  I like shipping early and often, and believe in automation; I consider continuous integration and peer review to be first-class activities.  I don't think there's a trade-off between quality and speed - it's about building the right thing well.  I'm passionate about what I do, and will never finish learning; I enjoy helping others to learn, too.  I can help you build teams and bring products to market.

My current goals are to spend more time talking to customers and to continue growing my leadership skills.

# Experience

## Technical Lead, [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com)
### London, 06/2017 - today

Heading up the engineering function at EF, I'm responsible for building the team from scratch and providing systems to multiply the effectiveness of the company's operations.  We're defining a category, so product discovery and strategy are important components of my work here.

## Technical Lead, Style.com 
### London, 09/2015 - 06/2017

Building a team and delivering beyond launch the new Style.com, a best-in-class luxury ecommerce experience.  I ensured technical excellence of our development efforts, and introduced improvements to add value and increase velocity.  I mentored junior developers and provided technical consultancy to product owners.  I worked to evangelise our engineering efforts across the company and externally, in order to further build cohesive, effective delivery teams.  We built and launched the site in the UK and EU before the product was sold and the company shut down.

## Senior Software Engineer, [Bright North](http://www.brightnorth.co.uk/)
### London, 01/2014 - 08/2015

As a full-stack engineer, I provided technical, architectural and procedural leadership for our [Convolo platform](http://www.brightnorth.co.uk/platform.html), a microservice-based application featuring a high-performance messaging pipeline, real-time graphing interface and batch ETL jobs.  I delivered a [recruitment website](https://functional.works-hub.com), as well as working on a social ecommerce platform [Social Superstore](http://socialsuperstore.com/), and Bright North's core product after a pivot. We work to firm deadlines with a strong quality ethic.  Development methodology was pragmatic not dogmatic, based on agile and TDD.

## Software Engineer, [Softwire](http://www.softwire.com)
### London, 06/2013 - 01/2014

Delivered a project for the company's largest client, [Metaswitch](http://www.metaswitch.com/), a platform handling messaging for over 40% of all US mobile subscribers, involving a major body of 3rd-party legacy code.  As the experienced development resource on the project, I established processes to bridge the culture gap between the two companies, introducing test infrastructure, SCM and modern TDD development.  I mentored junior developers on coding best practice, and acted as a subject matter expert on the application.  I achieved far more through the introduction of stronger dev practices improving the speed and quality of delivery than through the features I personally built.

I was active in company-wide learning and knowledge sharing, writing internal blog posts and contributing to technical discussion in our forums, organising external speakers for regular "Lunch & Learn" sessions, and speaking at those sessions myself.

Tech stack: Java / Perl / MySQL / SQL Server  

## Senior Platform Developer, [AMEE](http://www.amee.com)
### London, 01/2012 - 06/2013

Implementing the back-end and designing the full architecture, including infrastructure, persistence, service architecture and messaging, and the accompanying systems and processes - BDD/TDD, continuous integration, deployment strategies, scalability and resilience, security and third party integrations.  My team built core business platforms supporting data access, RESTful APIs, batch database extracts and data analysis tooling.  I was the domain expert on application architecture and development practices.

I worked on all aspects of three core products: an emissions calculation platform, a high-performance IOT data ingestion system, and after a company pivot in late 2012, a business supply-chain risk analysis platform..
